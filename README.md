# Tomb-Raider-1-2-3-4-Map-viewer-and-levels

* Only Tested on Tomb Raider 1 Maps
* Tomb Viewer is over 12 years old, seems to work ok mostly, just run it in the lowest mode and on fullscreen. 
* Tomb Viewer uses '+' and '-' keys to move up or down (usally on the right side with the numpad keys), directional arrows to move around horizonatally.

### Instructions
- View readme.txt for instruction on how to move.
- Load the .PHD file extensions from the Tomb-Raider-1 folder
- .tr2 for Tomb Raider 2 and 3
- .tr4 for Tomb Raider 4, Revalations
- .trc for Tomb Raider 5, chronicles

### Windows based OS

* If you run into issues try running in compatibility mode.
* I ran this on windows 10 using parallels on a mac.

### Misc

- Screenshots included of what to expect.
