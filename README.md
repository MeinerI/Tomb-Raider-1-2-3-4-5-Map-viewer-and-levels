# Tomb-Raider-1-2-3-4-Map-viewer-and-levels

* Tested and working for all maps in repository.
* Tomb Viewer is over 12 years old, seems to work fine on Windows 10, just use in full screen mode. 
* Tomb Viewer uses '+' and '-' keys to move up or down (usally on the right side with the numpad keys), directional arrows to move around horizonatally.

### Instructions
- View readme.txt for instruction on how to move.
- Load the .PHD file extensions from the Tomb-Raider-1 folder
- .tr2 for Tomb Raider 2 and 3
- .tr4 for Tomb Raider 4, Revalations
- .trc for Tomb Raider 5, chronicles

### Windows based OS

* If you run into issues try running in compatibility mode.
* I ran this on windows 10 using parallels on a mac.

### Misc

- Screenshots included of what to expect. 
- Keep in mind that these are all the PC game levels (usually found in the DATA folder of the extracted ISO).
- Playstation discs format levels will not work with this program, at least I had no luck.

### Credits
* Levels extracted from Misc sources on http://www.theisozone.com/
